# Minimalistic Engine.
This is an minimalistic implementation about the ideas behind of AlphaZero in the connect 4 game. 
It tries to simulate several games using a search approach (MCTS)  and after then, train a NN.

## Requirements.
* Python 3.
* PyTorch.

## Using.
Before to play with it. You have to train the algorithm.
```
python3 execute_training.py
```

After then, you will having files with the extension pt.
You have to modifie the path file and enjoy!

```
python3 Player_vs_AI.py
```
**Note:**
Maybe it has several bugs. You should check detailed implementation.... (sorry! :sad: )
